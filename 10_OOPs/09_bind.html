<!-- Notes:

1.Use-Case
You are:

Creating an instance of a class (React) that holds some configuration/data (library, server).

Attaching an event listener (click) to a button from inside the class constructor.

Wanting to respond to that button click by logging the internal state (this.library and this.server).

2.Goal
The main goal is to make sure that inside the handleClick() method, 
the this keyword still refers to the class instance, not to the button DOM element.

3.button.addEventListener('click', this.handleClick)
will cause this inside handleClick to refer to the DOM element (button), not the class instance.

4.The Problem Without .bind(this)
Then inside handleClick():
this === <button> — because event handlers are called with 
this pointing to the element that triggered the event, not your class. so this.library & this.server are undefined

5.Why Use .bind(this)?
.bind(this) fixes the value of this inside handleClick to always refer to the class instance (app object in your case).
this.handleClick.bind(this)
This creates a new function with this permanently bound to the instance of the class.
this.library === "React";
this.server === "https://localhost:3000";

6. Alternative Approaches
1. Use Arrow Function Instead (Not Reusable)
document.querySelector("#btn").addEventListener('click', () => this.handleClick());
Arrow functions don’t have their own this, so they use the one from the lexical scope.

Drawback: Every time this runs, it creates a new function, not reusable across multiple buttons or listeners. -->
