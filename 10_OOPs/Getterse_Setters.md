# Comparison of JavaScript Object Creation Approaches

## 🔍 Feature Comparison

| Feature / Approach         | `class` with getter/setter  | `function` constructor + defineProperty | Plain `object` with getter/setter  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Modern syntax**          | ✅ Yes (ES6+)                | 🚫 No (old-style, ES5)                  | ✅ Yes (for literals, but limited)  |
| **OOP support**            | ✅ Best choice               | ✅ Works                                 | ❌ Very limited                     |
| **Inheritance**            | ✅ Native via `extends`      | ✅ Possible via prototypes               | ⚠️ Limited via `Object.create()`   |
| **Code reusability**       | ✅ High                      | ✅ Medium                                | ❌ Low                              |
| **Private fields**         | ✅ Yes (`#privateVar`)       | ❌ No (must simulate with `_var`)        | ❌ No (properties are all visible)  |
| **Readability**            | ✅ Clean and intuitive       | ⚠️ Verbose                              | ✅ Simple (for small things)        |
| **Performance (creation)** | ✅ Efficient with prototypes | ✅ Efficient (less boilerplate)          | ⚠️ Less optimal for many instances |
| **Best for learning OOP?** | ✅ Absolutely                | ✅ Good to understand inner workings     | ❌ Not ideal                        |

## ✅ Recommended Use Cases

| Use Case                                 | Recommended Approach        |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Building apps, tools, services           | ✅ `class` with accessors    |
| Learning how JavaScript works internally | ✅ `function` constructor    |
| Simple config-like or small object       | ✅ `object` with accessors   |
| Working with teams or large codebases    | ✅ Use `class`               |
| Targeting older browsers (pre-ES6)       | ✅ Function + defineProperty |
