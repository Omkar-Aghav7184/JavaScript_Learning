/*Notes: 
1.How it's working:
You're using getters and setters for email and password, 
but you're storing the actual values in _email and _password.
This is a common pattern to avoid recursive setter calls.

2.Without internal _email and _password:
When you call this.email = email, the setter set email() gets invoked.

Inside that setter, if you do this.email = value again, 
youâ€™ll recursively call the setter infinitely, causing a RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded.
 Race condition between constructor and setters to set values
